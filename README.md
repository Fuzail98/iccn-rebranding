# iccn-rebranding

ICCN AWGateway is based on the tukan theme available in OPNsense packages. It has its own logos.
But sometimes on updating the firmware the logos revert back to OPNsense logos. Also the copyright names and links revert back to OPNsense.
When that happens, one can follow either of the following steps. These aare simple scripts one can run to see the changes back to ICCN.
One method is a bash script that should run on the shell of the gateway and the other is a python script, which can be run remotely as well.
